# BHARAT-INTERN_Task-1
# Stock Prediction 
In this project, I had the exciting opportunity to dive into the world of stock market analysis and prediction using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, by working on the data of Netflix.

Technologies utilized primarily for this project are :
* Python - for data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and model implementation.
* Jupyter Notebook - as the coding environment for interactive development.
* Keras library - to build and train the LSTM model.
