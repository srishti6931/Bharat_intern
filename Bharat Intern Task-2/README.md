# BHARAT INTERN_Task-2
# Titanic Classification 

In this project, a system is developed which tells whether the person will be saved from sinking and tends to give valuable insights into the factors that might have influenced survival during the Titanic catastrophe.

Tools and technologies used to develop this project are :
* Data Preprocessing - is done i.e; handle missing values, encode categorical features, and prepare the data for machine learning. 
* Model Building - Utilize a Random Forest Classifier & decision tree classifier to train the prediction model on the labeled training 
  dataset. 
* Model Evaluation - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy percent.
* Visualization - Explore survival trends based on different factors using interactive and informative plots. 
* Predictions - Generate predictions for the test dataset.
